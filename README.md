# Cross Compiler Builder
Build GCC and binutils for x86_64 OS development on a Debian-based host using one script.

# How to use
Use `chmod` to mark the script as executable, then run it. When asked, put your password. It takes an average of 30 minutes to complete and the result will be in $HOME/cross_compiler/bin
